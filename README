shp - Like PHP except you write your script in shell script

The shp utility works like PHP, but:

    o Instead of scripting in the PHP language, you use bash shell script

    o You use <?shp ... ?> instead of <?php ... ?> to embed the script

See INSTALL for installation instructions. After installing, see the shp(1)
man page for how to run it.

See COPYING for license.

See CHANGES for change history.

Enjoy!
